     * HOWEVER, OpenGL modifies the Modelview Matrix using POST-MULTIPLICATION.
     * This means that if were to specify to OpenGL a matrix modification 'A',

     * following operation:
     *
     * M = M * A
     *
     * So, for instance, if the Modelview Matrix were initialized to the
     * identity matrix 'I' and we were to specify a translation 'T' followed by
     * a rotation 'R' followed by a scaling 'S' followed by the inverse camera
     * transform 'C', then the Modelview Matrix is modified in the following
     * order:
     * 
     * M = I * T * R * S * C
     * 
     * Then, when OpenGL applies the Modelview Matrix to a point 'p', we would
     * get the following multiplication:
     *
     * M * p = I * T * R * S * C * p
     *
     * ^ So the camera transformation ends up being applied first even though
     * it was specified last. This is not what we want. What we want is
     * something like this:
     *
     * M * p = C * T * R * S * I * p
     *
     * Hence, to correctly transform a point, we actually need to FIRST specify
     * the inverse camera rotations and translations and THEN specify the
     * translations, rotations, and scalings applied to an object.
     *
     * We start by specifying any camera rotations caused by the mouse. We do

     * to render something to display in the program window. Because your
     * computer is slow, OpenGL ends up rendering only part of the scene before
     * it displays it in the program window. The rest of the scene shows up a
     * second later. This effect is referred to as "flickering". You have most
     * likely experienced this sometime in your life when using a computer. It
     * is not the most visually appealing experience, right?
     *
     * To avoid the above situation, we need to tell OpenGL to display the
     * entire scene at once rather than rendering the scene one pixel at a
     * time. We do so by enabling "double buffering".
     * 
     * Basically, double buffering is a technique where rendering is done using
     * two pixel grids of RGB values. One pixel grid is designated as the
     * "active buffer" while the other is designated as the "off-screen buffer".
     * Rendering is done on the off-screen buffer while the active buffer is
     * being displayed. Once the scene is fully rendered on the off-screen buffer,
     * the two buffers switch places so that the off-screen buffer becomes the
     * new active buffer and gets displayed while the old active buffer becomes
     * the new off-screen buffer. This process allows scenes to be fully rendered
     * onto the screen at once, avoiding the flickering effect.
     * 
     * We actually enable double buffering in the 'main' function with the line:
     
       glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH);
       
     * ^ 'GLUT_DOUBLE' tells OpenGL to use double buffering. The other two
     * parameters, 'GLUT_RGB' and 'GLUT_DEPTH', tell OpenGL to initialize the
     * RGB pixel grids and the depth buffer respectively.

      /* The next few lines of code are how we tell OpenGL to render
       * geometry for us. First, let us look at the 'glVertexPointer'
       * function.
       * 
       * 'glVertexPointer' tells OpenGL the specifications for our
       * "vertex array". As a recap of the comments from the 'Object'
       * struct, the "vertex array" stores all the faces of the surface
       * we want to render. The faces are stored in the array as
       * consecutive points. For instance, if our surface were a cube,
       * then our "vertex array" could be the following:
       *
       * [face1vertex1, face1vertex2, face1vertex3, face1vertex4,
       *  face2vertex1, face2vertex2, face2vertex3, face2vertex4,
       *  face3vertex1, face3vertex2, face3vertex3, face3vertex4,
       *  face4vertex1, face4vertex2, face4vertex3, face4vertex4,
       *  face5vertex1, face5vertex2, face5vertex3, face5vertex4,
       *  face6vertex1, face6vertex2, face6vertex3, face6vertex4]
       * 
       * Obviously to us, some of the vertices in the array are repeats.
       * However, the repeats cannot be avoided since OpenGL requires
       * this explicit specification of the faces.
       *
       * The parameters to the 'glVertexPointer' function are as
       * follows:
       *
       * - int num_points_per_face: this is the parameter that tells
       *                            OpenGL where the breaks between
       *                            faces are in the vertex array.
       *                            Below, we set this parameter to 3,
       *                            which tells OpenGL to treat every
       *                            set of 3 consecutive vertices in
       *                            the vertex array as 1 face. So
       *                            here, our vertex array is an array
       *                            of triangle faces.
       *                            If we were using the example vertex
       *                            array above, we would have set this
       *                            parameter to 4 instead of 3.
       * - enum type_of_coordinates: this parameter tells OpenGL whether
       *                             our vertex coordinates are ints,
       *                             floats, doubles, etc. In our case,
       *                             we are using floats, hence 'GL_FLOAT'.
       * - sizei stride: this parameter specifies the number of bytes
       *                 between consecutive vertices in the array.
       *                 Most often, you will set this parameter to 0
       *                 (i.e. no offset between consecutive vertices).
       * - void* pointer_to_array: this parameter is the pointer to
       *                           our vertex array.
